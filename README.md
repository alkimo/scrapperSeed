# ScrapperSeed

Small framework to get a bigger scrapper project going.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Installing

Clone the project locally

```
git clone https://github.com/alkimo/scrapperSeed.git
```

Create a virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv env
```

Run source to get it started

```
source env/bin/activate
```

Install all requirements libraries 

```
pip3 install -r configuration/requirements.txt
```

Run simple example to see if it's working properly

```
python3 script.py
```

It should then generate a html, and place a folder filled with the html, all of that, inside scrapped_data.
